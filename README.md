## How to install and run it

PiCL is using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) internally, so you'll need to have
this installed. It's also using the *npm* package manager.

To have this up and running, you can do the following:

    $ git clone git://github.com/mozilla/picl-server.git
    $ npm install

And you should be fine.

To make it run, just run `npm start` and you'll be all set!

## Testing

You can run the tests yourself using the `npm test` command. In case you want
to run the tests on a remote server, you can set the `TEST_REMOTE`
variable to the address of the server you want to test:

    $ export TEST_REMOTE=http://127.0.0.1:8080
    $ npm test
